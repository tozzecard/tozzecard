/**
 * Fitting a real name into the space a card gives it.
 *
 * The name is OCR'd off an identity document, so it arrives at whatever length the document says
 * and cannot be shortened by asking the holder to type something else. "Axel Urwawuska Atarubby"
 * is 23 characters and the folder's name slot holds about 18, which is how the card ended up
 * reading "Axel Urwawuska At…": a truncation that cuts mid-word and loses the surname, the one
 * part of a name that identifies anybody.
 *
 * So this abbreviates the way an embossing machine does rather than the way CSS does: the given
 * name and the family name are kept whole and everything between them collapses to initials. Both
 * ends of the name survive, which is what makes the result still recognisable as the holder.
 *
 * CSS truncation stays as the last resort for a single name longer than the slot, because there is
 * nothing left to abbreviate at that point.
