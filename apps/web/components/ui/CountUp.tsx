   *
   * The prop is kept so call sites do not have to change, but it no longer starts below the value.
   * Two reasons beyond the bug: a money figure animating up from zero means the screen displays a
   * number that is false for the length of the animation, which is the one thing a financial UI
   * must not do; and a logged-in dashboard opens into a task rather than a performance, which is
   * the one point every installed design skill agrees on.
   *
   * Value CHANGES still animate. That is the case the component was written for: a figure moving
   * because something happened is worth showing as movement.
