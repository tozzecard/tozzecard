/**
 * The desktop navigation bar.
 *
 * It replaces `TopBar`, which carried a wordmark and an avatar and nothing between them. That was
 * not a stylistic gap: desktop folds Earn and Account into `/home` (see `useRedirectDesktopToHome`
 * and the `(flow)` layout), so with no links in the chrome a desktop user had **no way to reach any
 * screen other than Overview** except through the avatar dropdown. The bar is what makes the second
 * destination exist.
 *
 * Measured off Stripe's own header at 1440px rather than guessed: 28px between the brand and the
 * nav group, 14px nav labels, a centred container that stops short of the viewport edge, and a row
 * tall enough (64px here, 76px there) that the links are not crowding the fold. What is *not*
 * borrowed is the item treatment: Stripe underlines, this app has spoken in pills since the mobile
 * bottom nav, and the product's own vocabulary beats the reference's.
 *
 * Activity is a `?panel=` link, not a route, because `/transactions` has no desktop page by design,
 * the `(flow)` group redirects desktop visitors to the matching drawer. Pointing the link straight
 * at the drawer's own URL keeps one source of truth for that state and leaves Back working.
 *
 * Mobile never renders this: the layout gates it behind `hidden lg:block`, and mobile keeps its
 * bottom nav untouched.
