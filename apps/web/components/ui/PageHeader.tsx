/**
 * The page's own name, above everything else on it.
 *
 * Desktop had none. The navigation bar ended and a card began, so the first thing a reader's eye
 * landed on was a rounded rectangle with no statement of what screen they were on, and with two
 * destinations in the bar now, "which one am I looking at" is a real question rather than a
 * rhetorical one. Every reference names its page: Aave sets a 32px/700 title at the top of the
 * content column, and so does every dashboard measured beside it.
 *
 * 26px rather than Aave's 32px. Their title is the market name and carries a chain switcher; this
 * one sits above a summary strip whose figures should stay the loudest thing on the screen.
