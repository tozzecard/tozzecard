 * A titled block: a small muted heading, then whatever the block is.
 *
 * The markup here is not new: `mx-1 mb-2 text-sm font-medium text-muted` was already written out
 * by hand in five separate files, which is five chances for one of them to drift a pixel. The only
 * addition is `action`, a slot on the heading's right for the one control a section sometimes owns
 * (a "view all", a filter), because that row was otherwise being rebuilt inside each card. `info`
 * puts an ⓘ beside the title that explains it on tap.
