/**
 * The four figures a cardholder opens the app for, in one band above everything else.
 *
 * This is the piece the desktop Overview was missing, and its absence was the expensive one. The
 * screen's entire subject is three numbers: what the limit is, what is left to spend, what is owed,
 * and not one of them was anywhere the eye lands first. Spendable was a figure inside a card
 * inside the left column; the balance owed lived in a sub-panel that only existed while it was
 * non-zero, so the answer to "do I owe anything" was the presence or absence of a box; the limit
 * was on another screen entirely. Every dashboard measured puts this band first: Aave gives it a
 * full-width panel above its columns, debank a summary row.
 *
 * One card divided by hairlines rather than four floating cards. Four separate shadowed boxes read
 * as four separate objects that happen to be adjacent; these are four readings off one instrument,
 * and the shared border is what says so.
 *
 * A tile with `value === null` renders a dash, not a zero. Zero is a fact about the account,
 * "nothing is owed", and an unread contract is not that fact.
