/**
 * The row of actions that sits directly under the headline figure.
 *
 * Two things about it are borrowed and one is not. The shape is: one filled pill leading, the rest
 * outlined, sized to their labels rather than stretched: the eye is already on the number, so the
 * actions meet it there instead of being found further down. What is not borrowed is the count. The
 * reference has four and an overflow; this has two, or three when a balance is open, because those
 * are all the things a cardholder can do here. An overflow menu holding nothing is furniture.
 *
 * It scrolls rather than wraps. Three pills fit a 390px screen comfortably and a fourth would not,
 * and a row that wraps to two lines stops reading as one group of choices. `-mx-5 px-5` lets the
 * overflow run to the screen edge instead of clipping inside the page gutter.
 *
 * Pills are 44px rather than the 56px of a full-width `Button`. That is the floor for a touch
 * target, not a comfortable size for one, and it is the trade this layout makes: the primary action
 * gives up height to sit above the card rather than below it.
